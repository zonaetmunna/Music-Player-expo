## 🏗️ Production Build (Release APK)

1. Run this command to generate the `android` folder:

   ```bash
    npx expo prebuild --clean
   ```

2. Generate a new signing key:
   ```bash
    keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
   ```
3. copy the generated file to: `android/app/my-release-key.keystore`
4. edit `signingConfigs` and then `buildTypes` in `android\app\build.gradle`:

   ```bash
    signingConfigs {
            release {
                storeFile file('my-release-key.keystore')
                storePassword 'yourpassword'
                keyAlias 'my-key-alias'
                keyPassword 'yourpassword'
            }
    }
   ```

   ```bash
    buildTypes {
            release {
                signingConfig signingConfigs.release
                minifyEnabled false
                shrinkResources false
                proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android-optimize.txt"), "proguard-rules.pro"
            }
    }
   ```

5. ```bash
    npx expo export --platform android
   ```
6. ```bash
    cd android
   ```
7.

```bash
    ./gradlew clean
```

8.

```bash
    ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

- after successfull build, the output APK will be at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### 🔧 Development Build (Debug APK)

A **development build** lets you test features quickly with live logs and the React Native debug menu enabled.

#### Steps:
